# First Semester Project - RAT

<h2>We are aiming to solve these constraint satisfaction problems:</h2>
<h3>※ Rat in a maze<br>
※ Sudoku</h3>

<h4>We will hinge on the method of backtracking to find the most feasible solution to the above problems.<br>We are also working on the UI, which will enable the user to interact with the program more effectively.<br>We are including a facility to let the user solve these problems, by a manual approach, but also let him allow the computer to solve it too.</h4><br>

This is our 1st-Semester project, whose final review is pending in March 2022.
